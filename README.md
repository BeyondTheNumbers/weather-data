# weather-data
End of chapter challenge of Lynda.com course on using Python for data analysis

This project is the solution to an end of chapter challenge of a Lynda.com course on using Python for data analysis that I completed a while ago.

Lynda.com
Python: Data Analysis
Chapter 5: Weather Data with Numpy

Challenge:
After retrieving a list of weather stations and weather data from NOAA:
1) Find the year with the highest mean TMAX in Minneapolis (cold location)
2) Find the year with the lowest mean TMIN in San Diego (warm location)
3) In the same plot, show the TMAX and TMIN data throughout those specific years for those two cities

The goal here was to write simple code in a relatively short period of time (and not necessarily the most efficient code or most elegant solution at the expense of making it harder to read), but I included a number of comments on how to make it more sophisticated and/or efficient if one chooses to iterate and/or scale at a later time.

I cleaned up the code a bit, and included more comments, but otherwise left the original code mostly unaltered. In the interest of full disclosure: some (but not all) of the basic code snippets are introduced in the Lynda.com course tutorial. All of the comments are my own, and I did not copy-and-paste anything without understanding.
